# Cryptographic Analysis on SM4
This project serves as the preparation for non-linear attacks on the encryption scheme SM4.<br>
It looks deeply into the structure of SM4, defines the variables and their logic relationship.<br>
It reimplements the encryption and decryption algorithms, generating detailed test vectors.<br>
It aims at finding the transformable polynomials and annihilations.
